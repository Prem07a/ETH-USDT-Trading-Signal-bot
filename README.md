## Technical Analysis Indicators:
* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD indicator shows the relationship between two moving averages of the price of the trading pair. A buy signal is generated when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, indicating that the price is likely to increase.
* Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): The VWAP indicator calculates the average price of the trading pair over a given time period, weighted by the trading volume. This gives a more accurate picture of the true price of the trading pair, and can help to identify trends.
* Histogram: The histogram is the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. A positive histogram indicates that the price is increasing, while a negative histogram indicates that the price is decreasing.
